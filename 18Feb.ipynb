    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "API (Application Programming Interface):\n",
    "An API is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in Real Life:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather Data: Many weather applications and websites use APIs provided by weather services (like OpenWeatherMap, Weather.com) to fetch current weather data, forecasts, and other related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: APIs allow different parts of a software system to communicate, making it easier to develop and maintain modular applications.\n",
    "Interoperability: Enable communication between different software systems and platforms, facilitating integration.\n",
    "Reusability: APIs allow for reusability of services and data across different applications.\n",
    "Efficiency: APIs streamline the process of accessing and manipulating data and services, improving efficiency.\n",
    "Scalability: APIs can help in scaling applications by allowing the integration of new services and functionalities easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Risks: If not properly secured, APIs can expose sensitive data and functionalities to unauthorized access.\n",
    "Dependency: Applications become dependent on third-party services, which may affect functionality if the API changes or is unavailable.\n",
    "Complexity: Designing, developing, and maintaining APIs can be complex and time-consuming.\n",
    "Rate Limiting: APIs often have usage limits, which can restrict the number of requests an application can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "Web API:\n",
    "A Web API is an API that is accessed over a network using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. It allows applications to communicate and exchange data using web technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "API: General term that refers to any interface that enables communication between different software components.\n",
    "Web API: A specific type of API that is accessed over the web using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer):\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture: REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and is stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information the server needs to fulfill that request.\n",
    "Data Format: Typically uses JSON or XML.\n",
    "Design Principles: Resource-based, uses URIs to access resources, and adheres to a stateless communication protocol.\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture: SOAP is a protocol that uses XML for messaging and relies on a set of well-defined rules and standards for message structure and processing.\n",
    "Data Format: Always uses XML.\n",
    "Design Principles: Operation-based, uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for service definition, and typically follows a strict messaging pattern.\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP is more complex due to its strict standards and protocols.\n",
    "Performance: SOAP messages are heavier and slower to process because they use XML.\n",
    "Scalability: SOAP is less scalable due to its stateful operations and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature       \t      REST\t                                                       SOAP\n",
    "Architecture\tArchitectural style \t                                        Protocol\n",
    "Communication\tStateless\t                                                Can be stateful\n",
    "Message Format\t Typically JSON, but can use XML\t                            XML only\n",
    "Ease of Use \tSimple and easy to use\t                                       More complex\n",
    "Performance \tLightweight, faster\tHeavyweight,                                  slower\n",
    "Standards\t  Less rigid, flexible                               \tStrict standards and protocols\n",
    "Scalability \tMore scalable                                           \tLess scalable\n"
