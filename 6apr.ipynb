    "Q1. What is the mathematical formula for a linear SVM?\n",
    " Support Vector Machine (SVM) aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. For a linear SVM, the formula for the decision function is:\n",
    "f(x)=w^Tx+b\n",
    "        Q2. What is the objective function of a linear SVM?\n",
    "        The objective of a linear SVM is to maximize the margin between the two classes while ensuring correct classification of training data. The objective function combines both the margin maximization and the classification error minimization.\n",
    "Q3. What is the kernel trick in SVM?\n",
    "Kernel Trick:\n",
    "The kernel trick is a technique used to transform data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separator can be found, even if the data is not linearly separable in the original space.\n",
    "Q4. What is the role of support vectors in SVM Explain with example\n",
    "Support Vectors:\n",
    "Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and influence its position and orientation. These are the critical points that define the margin of the SVM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a 2D feature space where classes are separated by a hyperplane. The points closest to this hyperplane (i.e., on the margin) are the support vectors. These points are crucial because they are the most difficult to classify and hence define the optimal margin.\n",
    "Q5. Illustrate with examples and graphs of Hyperplane, Marginal plane, Soft margin and Hard margin in\n",
    "SVM?\n",
    "1. Hyperplane:\n",
    "The hyperplane is the decision boundary that separates different classes. In a 2D space, it is a line, while in higher dimensions, it is a plane or hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Marginal Plane:\n",
    "The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the support vectors. In a 2D space, the marginal planes are parallel lines on either side of the hyperplane, equidistant from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Hard Margin:\n",
    "A hard margin SVM is used when the data is linearly separable without any errors. It finds the hyperplane that perfectly separates the classes while maximizing the margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard Margin: The margin lines touch only support vectors, and no data points lie inside the margin or on the wrong side of the hyperplane.\n",
    "4. Soft Margin:\n",
    "A soft margin SVM allows some misclassifications to handle cases where the data is not perfectly separable. It introduces slack variables to allow for some data points to be within the margin or misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "Soft Margin: The margin lines may have some data points inside them or on the wrong side of the hyperplane. This approach helps in dealing with noisy data or overlapping classes.\n",
    "Graphical Illustrations:\n",
    "Hard Margin Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperplane: A straight line separating the classes.\n",
    "Marginal Planes: Parallel lines on either side of the hyperplane, touching only the support vectors.\n",
    "Soft Margin Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperplane: A straight line separating the classes with some points allowed inside the margin or on the wrong side.\n",
    "Marginal Planes: Similar to hard margin but with some points possibly within or across the margins, reflecting the trade-off between margin size and classification error.\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Linear SVM aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.\n",
    "Objective Function: Minimize the norm of the weight vector while ensuring correct classification.\n",
    "Kernel Trick: Allows SVM to operate in a higher-dimensional space implicitly.\n",
    "Support Vectors: Critical points that define the margin and influence the hyperplane's position.\n",
    "Hard vs. Soft Margin: Hard margin is for perfectly separable data, while soft margin allows for some misclassification to handle overlap and noise."
