    "Q1. What is the Probability density function?\n",
    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable to take on a particular value. The value of the PDF at any given point represents the relative likelihood of the random variable being near that point. The area under the PDF curve over an interval represents the probability that the random variable falls within that interval. For continuous distributions, the total area under the PDF curve is equal to 1.\n",

    "Q2. What are the types of Probability distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distributions can be categorized into two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Probability Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, Geometric distribution.\n",
    "Explanation: These distributions describe the probabilities of the outcomes of a discrete random variable, which can take on a finite or countable number of values.\n",
    "Continuous Probability Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Normal distribution, Exponential distribution, Uniform distribution.\n",
    "Explanation: These distributions describe the probabilities of the outcomes of a continuous random variable, which can take on any value within a given range.\n",

    "    return (1 / (math.sqrt(2 * math.pi) * std_dev)) * exponent\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "x = 5\n",

    "Number of Trials:\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: Defined for a fixed number of trials \n",

    "n.\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: Describes the number of events in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "Probability of Success:\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: Has a constant probability of success \n",
    "ùëù\n",
    "p.\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: Probability is derived from the mean number of successes in the interval.\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: Used when there is a fixed number of independent trials with two outcomes (success/failure).\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: Used for counting the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space.\n",

    "Q10. In normal distribution with respect to mean position, where does the least frequent data appear?\n",
    "In a normal distribution, the least frequent data points appear in the tails of the distribution. These are the values that are farthest from the mean, both in the negative and positive directions. The probability density function approaches zero as you move further away from the mean, indicating lower frequencies of those extreme values."
