    "Q1. What is Bayes' theorem\\\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental principle in probability theory and statistics that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It provides a way to update the probability estimate for an event as more evidence becomes available.\n",
    "Q2. What is the formula for Bayes' theorem?\n",

    "Q3. How is Bayes' theorem used in practice?\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is used in various practical applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical Diagnosis: To calculate the probability of a disease given a test result. For instance, if a test is positive, Bayes' theorem helps in determining the likelihood that the patient actually has the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam Filtering: In email filtering, it helps in classifying emails as spam or not spam based on the probability of certain words appearing in spam or non-spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian Inference: Used in machine learning for parameter estimation and updating beliefs based on observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Assessment: In finance and insurance, to estimate the likelihood of risk events based on historical data.\n",
    "Q4. What is the relationship between Bayes' theorem and conditional probability?\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is fundamentally based on conditional probability. It provides a way to compute the conditional probability of an event \n",
    "𝐴\n",
    "A given another event \n",

    "B.\n",
    "Q5. How do you choose which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for any given problem?\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are based on Bayes' Theorem with a strong assumption of feature independence. There are several types of Naive Bayes classifiers, and the choice depends on the nature of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use When: Features are continuous and assumed to be normally distributed.\n",
    "Example: Predicting whether a patient has a certain disease based on continuous measurements like blood pressure or cholesterol levels.\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use When: Features are discrete and represent counts or frequencies.\n",
    "Example: Text classification problems where features are word counts or term frequencies.\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use When: Features are binary (0 or 1) indicating the presence or absence of a feature.\n",
    "Example: Document classification where the presence or absence of certain keywords is used to classify the document.\n",
    "Choosing the Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Type: Determine if features are continuous, discrete, or binary.\n",
    "Distribution Assumption: Consider the distribution of features and select the model that matches the assumed distribution (e.g., Gaussian for continuous features).\n",
    "Application Domain: Choose based on the typical feature representation in the domain (e.g., text classification often uses Multinomial Naive Bayes).\n",
    "By considering these factors, you can select the Naive Bayes classifier that best fits the characteristics of your data and the problem you are trying to solve.\n",
