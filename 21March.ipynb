    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",
    "might choose one over the other.\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Converts each value of a categorical variable into a unique integer. This method \n",
    "is used when the categorical feature does not have an inherent order.\n",
    "Example: For a categorical variable \"Color\" with values \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" label \n",
    "encoding might map \"Red\" to 0, \"Green\" to 1, and \"Blue\" to 2.\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Similar to label encoding but specifically used for categorical variables where there is a meaningful order or ranking among the categories.\n",
    "Example: For a categorical variable \"Size\" with values \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large,\" ordinal encoding might map \"Small\" to 0, \"Medium\" to 1, and \"Large\" to 2, preserving the order of sizes.\n",
    "When to Choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Use when categories are nominal (i.e., no natural order). Example: \"Color.\"\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Use when categories have a natural order. Example: \"Size.\"\n",
    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",
    "a machine learning project.\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding (or Target Encoding) involves encoding categories based on the target variable's mean or another statistic for each category. This method considers how each category impacts the target variable, giving a better representation of the relationship between categorical features and the target.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset with a categorical variable \"Education Level\" and a target variable \"Income.\" Target Guided Ordinal Encoding would involve calculating the average income for each education level and then encoding the education levels based on these averages.\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is useful when categorical features are ordinal and you want to encode them in a way that reflects their relationship with the target variable, often improving model performance.\n",
    "Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. Positive covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase, and negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important for understanding relationships between variables and is used in various statistical analyses, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
    "Q4. For a dataset with the following categorical variables: Color (red, green, blue), Size (small, medium,\n",
    "large), and Material (wood, metal, plastic), perform label encoding using Python's scikit-learn library.\n",
    "Show your code and explain the output.\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the data\n",
    "data = {\n",

    "    'Size': ['small', 'medium', 'large'],\n",

    "# Create LabelEncoder instances\n",
    "le_color = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "le_size = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "le_material = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit and transform the data\n",
    "encoded_color = le_color.fit_transform(data['Color'])\n",
    "encoded_size = le_size.fit_transform(data['Size'])\n",

    "level. Interpret the results.\n",
    "To calculate the covariance matrix for variables like Age, Income, and Education Level:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert Education Level to numeric values if necessary (e.g., using ordinal encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. You are working on a machine learning project with a dataset containing several categorical\n",
    "variables, including \"Gender\" (Male/Female), \"Education Level\" (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD),\n",
    "and \"Employment Status\" (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time). Which encoding method would you use for\n",
    "each variable, and why?\n",
    "Gender: Label Encoding (since it is nominal, but could also use one-hot encoding).\n",
    "Education Level: Ordinal Encoding (because there is a meaningful order).\n",
    "Employment Status: Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding (depends on whether the order is meaningful; usually label encoding if order is not critical).\n",
    "Q7. You are analyzing a dataset with two continuous variables, \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity\", and two\n",
    "categorical variables, \"Weather Condition\" (Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy) and \"Wind Direction\" (North/South/\n",
