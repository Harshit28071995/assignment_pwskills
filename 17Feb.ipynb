    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "MongoDB:\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular, open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document, and data structure can be changed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational Databases:\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They provide flexible schemas and are optimized for horizontal scalability and high performance. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed table schema and can store a variety of data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, wide-columns, or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios to Use MongoDB Over SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema Flexibility: When the data model needs to be flexible and change over time without requiring migrations.\n",
    "High Volume of Data: When dealing with large volumes of data that need to be processed quickly.\n",
    "Unstructured Data: For storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON, XML, or BSON.\n",
    "Scalability: When horizontal scalability is needed to distribute data across multiple servers.\n",
    "Rapid Development: When rapid development and iteration are required, and the schema needs to evolve quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented: Stores data in BSON format (Binary JSON), which provides a flexible and schema-less structure.\n",
    "Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling through sharding, distributing data across multiple servers.\n",
    "Indexing: Supports indexing on fields in a document, improving query performance.\n",
    "Aggregation: Provides powerful aggregation framework for data processing and transformation.\n",
    "Replication: Supports replication with automatic failover, ensuring high availability.\n",
    "Flexible Schema: Allows dynamic schema, enabling documents in a collection to have different fields.\n",
    "Rich Query Language: Offers a rich query language, including support for ad-hoc queries, joins, and indexing.\n",
    "Geospatial Queries: Supports geospatial indexing and queries, enabling location-based data retrieval.\n",
    "Load Balancing: Balances the load across different nodes in a sharded cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB server\n",
    "client = MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",

    "# Create a collection\n",
    "collection = db[\"mycollection\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Database and collection created successfully.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record,\n",
    "and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
