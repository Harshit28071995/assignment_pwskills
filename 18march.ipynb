    "Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "Filter Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The filter method for feature selection evaluates the relevance of features using statistical techniques before applying a model.\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "Univariate Tests: Each feature is evaluated based on a specific metric (e.g., correlation coefficient, chi-square test).\n",
    "Rank Features: Features are ranked according to their scores.\n",
    "Select Top Features: A subset of top-ranked features is selected for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "Wrapper Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The wrapper method evaluates feature subsets by training a model on them and assessing their performance.\n",
    "How it differs:\n",
    "Model-based: Involves training and evaluating a model for each feature subset.\n",
    "Iterative: Typically uses search algorithms (e.g., forward selection, backward elimination) to find the best subset.\n",
    "Performance-oriented: Focuses on improving model performance.\n",
    "Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
    "Embedded Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Embedded methods perform feature selection as part of the model training process.\n",
    "Techniques:\n",
    "Regularization: Methods like Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regression.\n",
    "Decision Trees: Tree-based methods inherently perform feature selection by splitting nodes based on feature importance.\n",
    "Gradient Boosting: Importance of features is evaluated during boosting.\n",
    "Q4. What are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection?\n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignores Feature Interaction: Evaluates each feature independently, missing interactions between features.\n",
    "Model Agnostic: Does not consider the specific model being used, potentially selecting suboptimal features for a given model.\n",
    "Simplistic: May oversimplify feature importance, leading to the exclusion of useful features.\n",
    "Q5. In which situations would you prefer using the Filter method over the Wrapper method for feature\n",
    "selection?\n",
    "Situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Datasets: When dealing with high-dimensional data, as filter methods are computationally efficient.\n",
    "Preliminary Selection: As a first step to quickly reduce the number of features before applying more sophisticated methods.\n",
    "Model Agnosticism: When the feature selection needs to be independent of any specific model.\n",
    "Q6. In a telecom company, you are working on a project to develop a predictive model for customer churn.\n",
    "You are unsure of which features to include in the model because the dataset contains several different\n",
    "ones. Describe how you would choose the most pertinent attributes for the model using the Filter Method.\n",
    "Steps to Use Filter Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation: Ensure data is clean and preprocessed.\n",
    "Univariate Analysis: Apply statistical tests like chi-square for categorical variables and ANOVA F-test for continuous variables.\n",
    "Rank Features: Rank features based on the test scores.\n",
    "Select Features: Choose a subset of top-ranked features.\n",
    "Q7. You are working on a project to predict the outcome of a soccer match. You have a large dataset with\n",
    "many features, including player statistics and team rankings. Explain how you would use the Embedded\n",
    "method to select the most relevant features for the model.\n",
    "Steps to Use Embedded Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a Model: Select a model that supports embedded feature selection, such as Lasso regression or tree-based methods.\n",
    "Train Model: Fit the model on the dataset.\n",
    "Feature Importance: Extract feature importance from the model.\n",
    "Select Features: Select features based on importance scores.\n",
    "Q8. You are working on a project to predict the price of a house based on its features, such as size, location,\n",
    "and age. You have a limited number of features, and you want to ensure that you select the most important\n",
    "ones for the model. Explain how you would use the Wrapper method to select the best set of features for the\n",
    "predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Use Wrapper Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a Model: Select a predictive model (e.g., linear regression).\n",
    "Feature Subset Search: Use a search method like forward selection, backward elimination, or recursive feature elimination (RFE).\n",
    "Evaluate Subsets: Train the model on different subsets of features and evaluate performance using cross-validation.\n",
    "Select Best Subset: Choose the subset that gives the best performance."
