    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.\n",
    "It hides the internal details of how an object works and exposes only what is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Abstraction : is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have.\n",
    "It involves focusing on the essential features while ignoring unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class or superclass).\n",
    "It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes, allowing the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",
    "It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, and it can take on different forms or behaviors in different contexts.\n",
    "Polymorphism is often expressed through method overloading and method overriding."
