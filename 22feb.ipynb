    "Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.\n",
    "A DataFrame in pandas is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data\n",
    "structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). It is similar to a table in a database or an Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "A Series, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional array-like structure with an associated array of data labels, called its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality: A Series is one-dimensional, while a DataFrame is two-dimensional.\n",
    "Structure: A Series contains a single list of values, whereas a DataFrame contains multiple Series, one for each column.\n",

    "you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\n",
    "head(): To view the first few rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "tail(): To view the last few rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "describe(): To get a statistical summary of the DataFrame.\n",
    "info(): To get a concise summary of the DataFrame.\n",
    "drop(): To remove rows or columns.\n",
    "loc[] and iloc[]: To access rows and columns by labels or positions.\n",
    "groupby(): To group data by a specific column.\n",
    "merge(): To combine two DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel?\n",
    "Both Series and DataFrame are mutable in nature. You can change their content after they are created. \n",
    "However, Panel has been deprecated since Pandas version 0.25.0 and is no longer in use.\n",

    "a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the values are the Series."
