    "Nominal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, assigns a unique integer to each category in a categorical feature.\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset containing information about fruits. The \"fruit_type\" column can have values like \"apple\", \"banana\", and \"cherry\". Using nominal encoding, these could be encoded as follows:\n",
    "\"apple\" -> 0\n",
    "\"banana\" -> 1\n",
    "\"cherry\" -> 2\n",
    "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "Situations for Nominal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Low Cardinality: When the categorical feature has a low number of unique categories.\n",
    "Ordinal Relationship: When there's an implicit order among categories.\n",
    "Practical Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider the feature \"education_level\" with values: \"high school\", \n",
    "\"bachelor's\", \"master's\", and \"PhD\". If the model can interpret the order, nominal encoding is preferred:\n",
    "\"high school\" -> 0\n",
    "\"bachelor's\" -> 1\n",
    "\"master's\" -> 2\n",
    "\"PhD\" -> 3\n",

    "Explain why you made this choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding Technique: One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason: One-Hot Encoding is suitable for handling categorical data with a \n",
    "few unique values because it avoids imposing an ordinal relationship where none exists and ensures that the model treats each category independently.\n",
    "Q5. In a machine learning project, you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 5 columns. Two of the columns\n",
    "are categorical, and the remaining three columns are numerical. If you were to use nominal encoding to\n",
    "transform the categorical data, how many new columns would be created? Show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: Each categorical column has 'n' unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns Before Encoding: 5 (3 numerical + 2 categorical)\n",
    "Columns After Nominal Encoding: Each categorical column is replaced with a single column containing integer values.\n",
    "Total Columns After Nominal Encoding: 5 (same as before, since each categorical column is replaced by one column)\n",
    "Q6. You are working with a dataset containing information about different types of animals, including their\n",
    "species, habitat, and diet. Which encoding technique would you use to transform the categorical data into\n",
    "a format suitable for machine learning algorithms? Justify your answer.\n",
    "Encoding Technique: One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: In this case, the categories (species, habitat, diet) likely do not have a\n",
