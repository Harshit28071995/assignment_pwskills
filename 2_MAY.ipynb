    "Q1. What is anomaly detection and what is its purpose?\n",
    "Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unusual patterns, observations, or data points that do not conform to the expected behavior of the data. These unusual patterns are known as anomalies, outliers, or exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting fraud or malicious activities (e.g., in financial transactions or cybersecurity).\n",
    "Identifying defects in manufacturing processes.\n",
    "Monitoring health status in medical diagnostics.\n",
    "Detecting faults in system operations or equipment.\n",
    "Q2. What are the key challenges in anomaly detection?\n",
    "Key Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced Data: Anomalies are often rare, leading to a significant class imbalance.\n",
    "Variety of Anomalies: Anomalies can vary widely in their nature and context.\n",
    "High Dimensionality: High-dimensional data can make it difficult to detect anomalies.\n",
    "Dynamic Data: In some applications, the data distribution may change over time.\n",
    "Noise: Distinguishing between noise and actual anomalies can be challenging.\n",
    "Scalability: Efficiently processing large datasets to identify anomalies.\n",
    "Interpretability: Explaining why a particular data point is considered an anomaly.\n",
    "Q3. How does unsupervised anomaly detection differ from supervised anomaly detection?\n",
    "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "No labeled training data is available.\n",
    "Relies on the assumption that anomalies are rare and different from the majority of the data.\n",
    "Techniques include clustering, density estimation, and distance-based methods.\n",
    "Supervised Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires labeled training data with normal and anomalous instances.\n",

    "Q4. What are the main categories of anomaly detection algorithms?\n",
    "Main Categories:\n",

    "\n",
    "Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.\n",
    "Examples: Isolation Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks.\n",
    "Clustering Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify anomalies as points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to small/sparse clusters.\n",

    "Main Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneity: Normal data points are clustered closely together.\n",
    "Sparsity: Anomalies are far away from the dense regions of normal data points.\n",
    "Consistency: Distance metrics are consistent and reliable for differentiating between normal and anomalous points.\n",
    "Q6. How does the LOF algorithm compute anomaly scores?\n",
    "The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm computes anomaly scores by comparing the local density of a data point to the local densities of its neighbors.\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",

    "n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest. More trees can improve the robustness of the model.\n",

    "Q8. If a data point has only 2 neighbours of the same class within a radius of 0.5, what is its anomaly score\n",
    "using KNN with K=10?\n",
    "In KNN-based anomaly detection, the anomaly score can be interpreted based on the number of neighbors within a specified radius. If a data point has only 2 neighbors of the same class within a radius of 0.5 but K=10:\n",
