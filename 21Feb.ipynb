    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "Web Scraping:\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves making HTTP requests to a web page, retrieving the content, and parsing it to extract the desired information. This data can be stored for further analysis or used in various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Web Scraping Used?:\n",
    "Web scraping is used to collect large amounts of data from the web efficiently and quickly. It automates the process of copying information from websites, which would be time-consuming and prone to errors if done manually.\n",
    "Three Areas Where Web Scraping is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Research:\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting data on products, prices, and customer reviews from e-commerce websites to analyze market trends and competitive pricing.\n",
    "Data Aggregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gathering information from multiple sources to create comprehensive datasets. For example, aggregating news articles from various news websites.\n",
    "Social Media Monitoring:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting data from social media platforms to analyze user sentiment, trends, and public opinion on various topics.\n",
    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "Manual Copy-Pasting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually copying data from websites. This is feasible for very small amounts of data but impractical for larger datasets.\n",
    "HTML Parsing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using libraries such as Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content of web pages and extract the required data.\n",
    "Web Scraping Libraries and Frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using specialized libraries like Scrapy, Selenium, or Puppeteer that provide robust tools for web scraping.\n",
    "APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using public APIs provided by websites to access structured data directly. This is often the preferred method as it is more reliable and adheres to the site's usage policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "Beautiful Soup:\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it Used?:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of Use: Beautiful Soup provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.\n",
    "Flexibility: It can handle different parsers like lxml and html.parser, making it versatile in dealing with different types of HTML content.\n",
    "Robustness: It can handle poorly-formed HTML and can be used in conjunction with requests to scrape web content effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "Flask is used in web scraping projects for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a microframework that is easy to set up and use, making it ideal for small to medium-sized projects.\n",
    "Flexibility: It provides the flexibility to create RESTful APIs, making it easy to serve scraped data to other applications or front-end interfaces.\n",
    "Integration: Flask can be easily integrated with other Python libraries like Beautiful Soup for scraping and pandas for data manipulation.\n",
    "Rapid Development: Its simplicity allows for rapid development and iteration, which is essential in prototyping and developing web scraping applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.\n",
    "Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Provides scalable virtual servers (instances) to run the web scraping application. EC2 instances can be configured with the required specifications and can scale based on the workload.\n",
    "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Used to store large amounts of scraped data securely. S3 provides a scalable and durable storage solution for storing raw and processed data.\n",
    "Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Provides a managed relational database service to store and manage the structured data collected from web scraping. It supports various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.\n",
    "AWS Lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Executes code in response to triggers such as HTTP requests. It can be used to run scraping tasks on demand without provisioning servers, making it a cost-effective solution for periodic scraping tasks.\n",
    "Amazon CloudWatch:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Monitors the performance and health of the scraping application. CloudWatch can be used to set alarms, view logs, and gather metrics to ensure the application runs smoothly.\n",
    "Amazon API Gateway:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Creates, publishes, and manages RESTful APIs to expose the scraped data. It acts as an interface between the scraping application and the clients consuming the data."
