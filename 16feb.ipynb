    "Database:\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to manage, store, and retrieve data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: Fixed schema with predefined tables, columns, and data types.\n",
    "Structure: Table-based, with rows and columns.\n",
    "ACID Compliance: Strong adherence to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.\n",
    "Queries: Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: Dynamic schema, allowing for flexible data structures.\n",
    "Structure: Various types, including document-based, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, and graph databases.\n",
    "ACID Compliance: May not fully adhere to ACID properties; often follows BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) principles.\n",
    "Queries: Uses a variety of query languages, often specific to the type of NoSQL database.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j.\n",

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL (Data Definition Language):\n",
    "DDL is used to define and manage database schema objects such as tables, indexes, and relationships.\n",
    "CREATE: Used to create database objects such as tables, indexes, and databases.\n",
